Sure! Here is the breakdown of the given solution in bullet points:

1. The solution is a C++ class that defines a function called `uniqueOccurrences`.
   
2. The `uniqueOccurrences` function takes a vector of integers `arr` as input and returns a boolean value.

3. Inside the function, the input array `arr` is sorted in ascending order using the `sort` function.
   
4. The function then iterates through the sorted array to count the occurrences of each element and stores these counts in a separate vector named `ans`.
   
5. The loop keeps track of the current element being counted and the number of occurrences of that element before moving to the next unique element in the sorted array.
   
6. After calculating the occurrences, the function sorts the `ans` vector to arrange the counts in ascending order.
   
7. It then iterates through the sorted `ans` vector to check if there are any duplicate counts. If it finds any duplicate counts, the function returns false immediately.
   
8. If all counts in the `ans` vector are unique, the function returns true, indicating that the occurrences of elements in the input array `arr` are unique.

9. The function effectively determines if the occurrences of elements in the input array `arr` are unique and returns a boolean value accordingly.

This breakdown highlights the key steps and logic implemented in the `uniqueOccurrences` function.

class Solution {
public:
    bool uniqueOccurrences(vector<int>& arr) {
       
       vector<int> ans;
       int size = arr.size();
       sort(arr.begin(),arr.end());
       int i = 0;
       while(i<size){
        int count = 1;
        for(int j =i+1;j<size;j++){
            if(arr[i] == arr[j]){
                count++;
            }
            else{
                break;
            }
        }
        ans.push_back(count);
        i = i+ count;
       }

       size = ans.size();
       sort(ans.begin(),ans.end());
       for(int i =0;i<size-1;i++){
        if(ans[i] == ans[i+1]){
            return false;
        }
       }
       return true;
        
    }
};
